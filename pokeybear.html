    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer">  Tattooing felt like one of the only feasible ways to make a living wage as an artist. Comics are my lifelong focus but the industry is really broken. Thankfully it turns out tattooing is also really fun  </p>
    <p class="question"> What made you decide to stick with the handpoke method instead of a machine method?</p>
    <p class="answer"> I started with handpoke because it has cheaper startup cost and less risk of injuring someone when first starting out. Also the friend who was willing to teach me is a handpoke artist so it just made sense. There’s pros and cons to both but I’m gonna switch to machine soon to save time. I’m excited to see what doors machine opens, like solid linework and gradients rather than the pointillism of handpoke  </p>
    <p class="question"> Do you have a dream tattoo, if so, what does it look like? </p>
    <p class="answer"> I don’t know that I have a dream tattoo, but I’d like to work larger scale like a back piece at some point, I also think a tramp stamp would be cool to do</p>
