    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer">  
        I’ve been an artist my whole life and I always knew I wanted a career in a creative field. I grew up painting and drawing and then studied graphic design in college. I was never that passionate about graphic design, but didn’t know what else to do. I started getting tattoos in college by a lot of self-taught artists. I thought it was the coolest thing and had the thought that if I really wanted to do it I probably could, but it seemed so far fetched at the time. <br><br> Fast forward a little, I graduated college and had my first graphic design job and I was miserable (surprise!). I couldn’t see myself having a full time office job for the rest of my life, and the idea of becoming a tattoo artist never left my mind. I thought why not, cause at this point I really had nothing to lose. <br><br> Coincidentally, I started when COVID hit. I tattooed inconsistently for about 2 years, just practicing on myself, friends, and family. It wasn’t until April of 2022 I decided to quit my design job and see if I could make it tattooing. I’m now a full time tattoo artist in a studio with some friends I have met along the way! </p>
    <p class="question"> What advice would you give to someone who’s getting their first tattoo?</p>
    <p class="answer"> Researching artists is the most important part in my opinion. You’re trusting someone to put something permanent on your body! I always like when my clients tell me it’s their first tattoo so I can give them some more information about my booking and tattooing process. Eat a good meal and drinks lots of water beforehand. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and voice your concerns during your appointment. As I said, you’re putting so much trust into your artist! </p>
    <p class="question"> Do you have a dream tattoo, if so, what does it look like? </p>
    <p class="answer"> My dream tattoo is a full body piece covering my backside from the artist Jess Chen (@__jesschen__). She does a lot of large scale floral pieces and it is my goal to be tattooed by her. I want it to start on the back of my legs and go all the way up to my back. Her use of both black and color are so insanely beautiful. </p>
