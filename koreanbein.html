    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer">  I'm 26 so I kind grew up in the tumblr type era thing where I would just see a lot of images of people who had tattoos with sleeves, floral sleeves were really in back then. I just remember seeing them and being like “Oh my gosh, what a beautiful thing to be able to decide to have something on your body permanently” It was just hard to wrap my mind around when I was younger, permanency is a very difficult concept that I still have trouble understanding. It is just a beautiful way of <b>expressing bodily autonomy </b> and taking control over your body and making decisions for yourself and yourself only. Something that you can hold close forever is a really beautiful concept to me; something that you can wear everyday, hold everyday, and carry with you everyday was a really beautiful concept to me. I think it’s one of the most ultimate choices to be able to make for your own body and life. </p>
    <p class="question"> What’s the most fulfilling aspect of your practice and what’s the most difficult aspect? </p>
    <p class="answer">I think the most fulfilling aspect of my tattoo practice at the moment feels like when people trust me with their first tattoos. Just general trust with one’s body with me is really rewarding. The trust that someone has to be able to have with me to guide them through a very vulnerable and painful process is such an honor. I feel very grateful and happy that people feel like they can be safe with me. There’s no such thing as a safe space for everyone because I’m always learning. I learn as I go, but I try to make it as safe as possible for everyone that I can include. Receiving a tattoo is a very vulnerable process and can be a very triggering process for many people. It’s inherently painful, and being trusted with guiding that and being in the space with you during such a vulnerable time is such an honor. I truly am grateful for all of my clients, and being able to do this as a full-time job is really something I would’ve never imagined. So that’s the most fulfilling aspect of my practice; being able to be trusted with people’s bodies, triggers, emotions, physical aspects, emotional aspects, just everything. </p>
    <p class="answer">The most difficult aspect would be doubting myself and saying, 'I do not deserve this. I do not deserve people’s trust with this practice. There is someone out there better for them.' It’s just I have a lot of self-doubt that comes up because it is such an intense process and it is permanent. Which is such a hard concept to wrap my head around, but I do it every day. It’s really easy for me to sway into doubt and be like, 'Why would anyone trust me with something so important?'  </p>    
    <p class="question"> Do you have a dream tattoo, if so, what does it look like? </p>
    <p class="answer"> I don’t really have a dream tattoo. There are many artists that I would love to get tattooed by. But I think that my body is always going to be changing and the tattoos on my body are always going to be changing. I believe that I’m going to have layers and layers of tattoos all over my body one day so it’s hard to say what my dream tattoo would look like. I have a tattoo by <a href="#" onclick="openPopup('jesschen.html')"> Jess Chen,</a> who is an artist based outside of Toronto on my right sleeve, and that is a very important piece to me. I’m very happy to wear it, and I don’t think I’ll cover it anytime soon. That was a dream piece, if anything, and I love it so much. To describe the right sleeve that is my dream tattoo, I would say it’s a painting that my grandfather passed down to our family. There are 4 paintings for each season in Korea, in rural farm Korea. There is Spring, Winter, Summer, and Fall. Our family got Spring and Summer gifted to us, and my father’s brother received winter and fall. So I combined the Summer and the Spring aspects, and Jess Chen designed it into a sleeve, and it’s my perfect, wonderful, and one of my most cherished tattoos that I’ve always wanted. It took a year to get it, and I still love it so much to this day.</p>
