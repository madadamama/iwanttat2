    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer"> I think that for me art has always felt like a form of self expression, and the world of tattooing and body modification an extension of that. Growing up, I remember seeing many artists, queer folk, alternative people or creatives having tattoos, and with tattoos being shunned by “polite” or mainstream society it felt like another way to express myself and identify with these other populations that I felt so much a part of. Because of this I started getting tatted as soon as I turned 18 and never looked back :). I honestly didn’t really think of it as a viable career path until my final year of undergrad when I was planning next steps and what i wanted my life to look like post grad. I also have to hugely credit witnessing the explosion of queer/femme independent tattoo artists on instagram as truly igniting that spark for me. Seeing people similar to myself tattooing showed me that it was in fact an accessible career path and not just one meant for gruff older white dudes hahah.  </p>
    <p class="question"> What’s one thing you wish another tattoo artist told you before you started tattooing? </p>
    <p class="answer"> I wish that when I was first learning I heard more tattoo artists talk about it being ok to turn down projects that feel out of one’s ability/comfort zone as a beginner artist and that feeling confident about the tattoo was more important than just saying yes for the $$. Also to not be afraid to reach out to other tattoo artists to trade or make connections! I’m kind of a shy person so I definitely struggle with being the one to reach out first. Also ! I wish people talked more about the unsexy side of being a tattoo artist like how to determine your prices, marketing yourself, where to get the best deals on supplies, licensing and legal stuff etc etc. </p>
    <p class="question"> Do you have a dream tattoo, if so, what does it look like? </p>
    <p class="answer"> Oo that’s a good question! I’m honestly not sure, I think my style is always evolving and growing so tattoos that I want to create are always changing. I honestly do love doing sweet lil tattoos that are meaningful to the person like a childhood item or a beloved pet etc. Also anything fantasy or nerdy, any tattoo that relates to some kind of media im also a fan of is always fun. At the end of the day my dream for tattoos is honestly always just to feel proud of what I made and that the person is happy with it.</p>
