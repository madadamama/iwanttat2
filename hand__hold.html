    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer">  originated from my drawing practice, which started getting responses from friends !</p>
    <p class="question"> Whatâ€™s one thing you wish you knew before you started tattooing? </p>
    <p class="answer"> how hard it is !!! technically, socially/emotionally, etc. just really an intense thing to do. maybe feels like too much power to wield // too much impact on other people for my comfort tbh </p>
    <p class="question"> Do you have a dream tattoo, if so, what does it look like? </p>
    <p class="answer"> tattooing is always a collaborate process for me and it is about what the client and i come up with together. my dream tattoo would be one that feels very collaborative.</p>
