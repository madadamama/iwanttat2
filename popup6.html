    <p> Xandi's dream tattoo audio transcript</p>
    <p class="tiny"> Yeah, so I've always wanted the tattoo property of Xandi Pink because I think it says a lot and Nadine was there, so I put her name underneath. She didn't write it or anything, but you could probably already tell that because there's no dash next to the name. If there was a dash next to the name, then you definitely would have thought that it was Nadine's dream tattoo, but it's my dream tattoo. It's also Allie's dream tattoo.   </p>
