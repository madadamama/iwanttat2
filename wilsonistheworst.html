    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer">  I became interested in tattooing as a teenager when I saw some really well done hand pokes on instagram – mostly by <a href="#" onclick="openPopup('jacksontattoos.html')"> @jackson.tattoos</a> My perception of hand poke/stick and poke work was always of more traditional and ancient tattoos, or very poorly done, unhygienic basement tattoos.  But the work I was seeing online in 2017-2018 really inspired me – I just loved how organic and handmade they looked and I was really drawn to the textures.  I guess I just felt like I really needed to try it! I’m very visually inclined and love trying new art forms so at the time, when I was about 18, this was another thing to try.  Thank god for my very generous and trusting friends who lent me their skin while I was learning…! </p>
    <p class="question"> What made you decide to stick with the handpoke method instead of a machine method? </p>
    <p class="answer">  I have never used a machine, and I don’t have any interest in learning at the moment! I love hand pokes for so many reasons.  I think mostly, again, I love how handmade and organic the result is.  I also feel my art style works really well with this specific method.  I’ve been tattooing for 5 years now but I feel like I learn more and more about handpicking and how to get better every time I tattoo.  Handpokes also hurt so much less than machine tattoos, heal so quickly, and are so easy to take care of (usually…).  I love how surprised people at how easy hand pokes are to receive.  I think most of all I love how deliberate and slow the process is. It has really helped me stay present and ease so much of my anxiety in just focusing on one, slow tattoo at a time. </p>
    <p class="question"> What’s the most fulfilling aspect of your practice and what’s the most difficult aspect? </p>
    <p class="answer"> I think the most fulfilling aspect would be the human connection. I get to meet so many people from so many walks of life.  It still feels unreal that people come to me, of all people, to get something permanent on their bodies… But the vulnerability and trust we share with one another in such a short period of time after meeting is so crazy and just such a wonderful unique experience that I’m in awe of every day.  The most difficult aspect is honestly navigating being self employed and the instagram algorithm… It’s scary and weird to know that I completely rely on instagram for my income, that so many artists need to keep feeding the algorithm with their work so they can continue to make an income.  It really takes so much out of the process for me, but I have to keep posting! And I do love sharing my work online, it’s just difficult and annoying to share work on a social media platform.</p>
