        <p class="landing-text">Ariana and her tattoos</p>
        <p class="question" id="introLink1">1. Can you introduce yourself please?</p>
        <p class="answer"> Hi, my name is Ariana. I'm Allie's older sister. And I am a fresh grad working in New York City. </p>
        <p class="question" id="introLink2">2. How many tattoos do you have?</p>
        <p class="answer">  I've lost track of the tattoos I have. I think I have about 20. </p>
        <p class="question" id="introLink3">3. When did you get your first tattoo and when did you get your last tattoo? </p>
        <p class="answer">  Okay, so I got my first ever tattoo in 2019 and that was the one on my <a href="#" onclick="openPopupImage('L1040035.jpg')">inner leg.</a><br>And then the most recent tattoo I got or the last tattoo I got was actually this past month. It was on my <a href="#" onclick="openPopupImage('gatattoo2.jpg')">left knee.</a> </p>
        <p class="question" id="introLink4">4. What was the experience with your tattoos and why do you keep getting more? </p>
        <p class="answer"> I think all my tattoos are memorable um I think I have quite a high pain tolerance so I think that's why like it doesn't <br> scare me to go  and get more tattoos I definitely am afraid of needles so I don't like watching when the tattoo artists <br> are you know jabbing me with little things that feel like little knives. But I definitely think as time has gone on by that <br> I enjoy making connections with tattoo artist that I really like especially there's one tattoo artist that my friend introduced <br> me to in Hong Kong and I loved her studio and I loved her work so much that I kept on going back to her that even when I <br> was in London because she moved there I went to go to her studio like that's how and I it was so nice seeing her and just <br>catching up because we haven't seen each other in like two years so it felt like reuniting with a friend even though really <br> like she's my tattoo artist but yeah and she does remember me but that's also because I we I think we left such a big <br> impression because we went together and she was so shocked that we were sisters she thought we were friends </p>
        <p class="question" id="introLink5">5. Can you describe each tattoo and the story behind it? </p>
        <p class="answer">Okay so the first tattoo I ever got in 2019 was with my brother and we got our family last name and then the next tattoo I got was a year later during I want to say Covid and it was a tattoo of a famous actress in Hong Kong and I watched this film I think it was called the I think it's called the 14 Amazon this great film and it's very much ahead of its time and you know I thought it was a great way to pay homage to my love for Hong Kong this is not in particular order I'm just doing it based off like where they are on my leg the Wes Anderson tattoo on the outside of my right foot is a tattoo my friend picked for me because we both love Wes Anderson and we both love tattoos so we thought why not get a tattoo so she picked her favorite film which was Moonrise Kingdom and I got that tatted and then I picked a pin from the Life Aquatic of Steve Zissou and that she picked that for and I picked that for her then on my left outer foot is a tattoo I got with my sister for her as a gift for her 18th birthday and it's these two stars holding the hands of each other and it says thanks for letting me shine dad something like that right and so it made me think big sister little sister then the next tattoo which is on the actual foot of my left foot is a drawing of Keith Haring with a heart because that's my dad's favorite artist and introduced me to him when I was a kid then on top of my feet so like at my ankle in the front is the song is the two words 1999 Prince so that's in that is for reference to this song by Prince oh someone's calling you  </p>
        <p class="question" id="introLink6">5. Can you describe each tattoo and the story behind it? (continued) </p>
        <p class="answer">So my tattoo, 1999 Prince, comes from the song by Prince and basically growing up, my dad and I would say when and if I ever got married instead of the traditional song, I don't know, like you play down the aisle, we would play that song. Like it was our song. So those are my legs and then the ones on my thighs, oh yeah well like upper legs, they're not so much, okay wait actually the one on my right upper thigh is a woman holding a match and then there's a fire and then the one on my left knee is a flower with a bunny that comes out. I love rabbits, I am also the year the rabbit and I love flowers so I just thought that was nice and it was by a tattoo artist that did a flash and I really like her work and then the other one was by a French illustrator and I saw her work and I got it and those two, it's not so much the significance of the tattoo but more so the placement and some may think it's ridiculous but getting a tattoo on a place that growing up was very insecure about it has made me appreciate like my body more. But like yeah anyways, so then those are my tattoos and then I have a tattoo Starting with my right arm.I have a tattoo that's kind of hidden and it's of someone hugging them hugging themselves I think and Some people think it looks like a clock, but I think it looks like a person but I got this at the end of my of 2021 when I say the end I'm referring to like my first semester back at school and online school and it was a really rough time for me and to finish on such a high note and to do well I got this tattoo to be like 'It's okay. You can take care of yourself and You got this' and then the tattoo of the rabbit with the peace sign, it's more so just because I really like the tattoo artist work and it's a very fond memory where I, as someone who likes to be in control, was very spontaneous and just got it and like that's how I met this tattoo artist that I really like. Then I have two more on my left arm. I have one that is a flower, and I have a flower of the work by Yayoi Kusama, who is one of my favorite artists, and that's to commemorate my summer in New York in 2021 because it was really a, just like a great summer and I was like, why don't I just get a tattoo for memes. Then on the back of my left arm near my elbow is a tattoo that says, Loser Planet. I could spend a whole hour just talking about what the meaning of it, but it's like an homage to my friends. From high school. Yeah, from high school. Then on my back I have one tattoo with the letter R, which is for my mom. Then I have a tattoo with a tattoo on my right arm. Of two rabbits on a moon, so one of them is me and the other one is my grandpa because we're both year of the rabbits.  Then one for fun, that I think says a lot about me as a person, but I have a tattoo of, it's another flash by the same tattoo artist that did my bunny with a peace sign and it's inspired by the labyrinth, the film. And then some stars surrounding it. But yeah those are my tattoos, I have a good amount.   </p>
