    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer">  I had a lot of friends that did tattoos actually! Some of them just practiced it for fun, on themselves or on friends (sometimes for free, sometimes just for cheap). One of them told me that my art style would translate well into flash, and that I should consider picking up handpoke. <br><br> But honestly, that was only my introduction into it. What got me invested in it, for real, was when I did a project about DIY tattoo artists for school— much like the project you’re doing now! I interviewed several artists, as well as people who had several handpoke tattoos. Everyone who talked about it held such a passion for more than just the art of it, but for the community that surrounds tattoos. The bonds made with other artists and with clients, and the privilege that comes with tattoos: being trusted to fundamentally change another persons body. It made tattooing a deeper practice, and I feel very lucky to have started with that already in mind. </p>
    <p class="question"> What’s one thing you wish another tattoo artist told you before you started tattooing? </p>
    <p class="answer"> In terms of technique? That every persons skin is going to hold ink differently. Also, that every body part is going to hold ink WAY differently. I was mainly just doing arm and leg tattoos at first, feeling crazy confident. Everything was nice and clean. Then I did a stomach tattoo. I really thought, “oh my god. Am I THAT bad at this?” My lines were clean, but it was so light. It had to learn that it requires a different handle and understanding of the “softer” parts of the body. <br> <br> In terms of business practice: I wish someone had told me how to build confidence when pricing a tattoo. I think people see artists who don’t work in traditional shops and think that their work is “lesser than.” It’s hard not to let that idea seep into yourself and your pricing. When I first started, I charged maybe $20 - $50 for a tattoo, because I was just practicing. Raising the price of my work has been really tough, especially because I still feel so new to the whole tattoo world. But it’s about valuing the physical labor of the work, and the hours spent getting to that level of skill. It’s about being fair to yourself and your art. <br> <br> In terms of business practice: I wish someone had told me how to build confidence when pricing a tattoo.

    <p class="question"> Do you have a dream tattoo, if so, what does it look like? </p>
    <p class="answer"> I do! I’ve always wanted two rabbits, mid-leap, on either side of my upper ribcage. I love rabbits and I feel like the movement would look so, so nice. 

        <br> <br>I’m waiting until after I’ve had top surgery to get it. The skin would probably pull and warp them if I got them pre-surgery. I feel like it’ll be worth the wait, and almost a congratulatory piece.</p>
