    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer">  i had always been interested visual art & tattoos growing up but never had plans to become a tattoo artist. however, in college i was doing a lot of dot work drawings i thought would be cool as handpoke tattoos and also started getting tattooed by a local artist who was self taught and saw that i could teach myself too. from there, i started tattooing myself & friends to learn and progressively got better.  </p>
    <p class="question"> What’s one thing you wish another tattoo artist told you before you started tattooing? </p>
    <p class="answer"> i wish another artist emphasized the importance of considering how a tattoo is going to age overtime and that the client has an informed understanding of that in relation to the tattoo they’re getting. </p>
    <p class="question"> Do you have a dream tattoo, if so, what does it look like? </p>
    <p class="answer"> i don’t think i have a “dream” tattoo but i’m really excited to see how the composition of all my tattoos changes over time as i add to my collection.</p>
