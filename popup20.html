    <p> Grace's dream tattoo </p>
    <p class="tiny"> I wasn’t sure what design I’d want because this isn’t really something I’ve thought about before, so I just started drawing some flowers! I’ve always loved flowers and as someone whose drawing abilities are pretty limited, I’d always doodle flowers everywhere and so, I think it would be a good representation of me </p>
