    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer">  i was always into drawing, and got my first tattoo a few days after my 18th birthday. i was making a lot of art in college and the thought that i could somehow put it permanently onto my body was interesting to me. being tattooed helped me better understand who i am and i like to bring that clarity to others. </p>
    <p class="question"> What’s the most fulfilling aspect of your practice and what’s the most difficult aspect? </p>
    <p class="answer"> it's most fulfilling when i have a cool, trusting and relaxed client who either wants to collaborate on a shared vision, or is really into the things i already draw. it feels so good to finish a project with someone and we are both happy about how the tattoo looks! the most difficult part is probably having to rely on social media and constantly be putting yourself out there. sometimes it can feel like you can't just make tattoos for yourself and your clients, it also needs to pass the instagram vibe check, and if it doesn't it can really tank your self esteem. </p>
    <p class="question"> Do you have a dream tattoo, if so, what does it look like? </p>
    <p class="answer"> i think my dream tattoo to do would be if someone came to me with an empty arm and wanted me to make an entire sleeve. the contents would really depend on the person, i have done a lot of half sticker-sleeves over time, but doing an entire sleeve project planned out from start to finish in my style would be really fun. probably some mushrooms, animals, and silhouette blocks similar to the stuff i draw already. it's hard to envision because i feel like tattooing is often about meeting your clients wishes moreso than your own, i usually am considering what they want first so i can meet that expectation. having no expectations, and someone who just lets me tattoo whatever i wanted, every once in awhile would be a dream. i think a lot of tattooers really embrace an open ended project with a chill person who trusts us.</p>
