    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer"> i actually wasn't very interested in tattooing until i realized a few years ago that fine-line tattoos existed! after this, i began doing research on tattoo history and what makes a good tattoo. i made a challenge for myself to learn and be proficient at giving them. i've only been tattooing for 1.5 years, so i'm always learning, every day. my friends always told me i should tattoo, so eventually i just ended up trying! i've also never tattooed on fake skin. </p>
    <p class="question"> Whatâ€™s one thing you wish another tattoo artist told you before you started tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer">i wish i knew how up-and-down, not promised, it would be. i always have clients that are interested, but working every weekday 9-5 is not a guarantee. if i had known the level of anxiety before each month would begin, i might've been a little more hesitant to jump in full-time. </p>
    <p class="question"> Do you have a dream tattoo, if so, what does it look like? </p>
    <p class="answer"> i'd love a huge back-piece! i'm not sure of what. i'm just too scared to get one yet haha</p>
