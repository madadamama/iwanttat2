    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer">  I started getting tattoos in college and just became obsessed with the art form! As a trans person, tattoos are an amazing way to reclaim my body especially when experiencing dysphoria. I feel lucky to have many queer and trans clients and getting to be a part of their journey in reclaiming themselves.  </p>
    <p class="question"> What’s one thing you wish another tattoo artist told you before you started tattooing? </p>
    <p class="answer"> How personal tattooing is! I love tattooing for so many reasons, including how personal it is, but it is so important before starting to understand the connection you’re making with clients. Tattooing is an intimate experience for many reasons, from just closeness and consent needed to give a tattoo to knowing that your art is on someone’s body forever! While tattooing can feel like an easier art form to jump into, it’s one that requires so much care and thought for each of your clients and can end up being mentally difficult if you don’t have the space for this personal exchange with your clients! </p>
    <p class="question"> Do you have a dream tattoo, if so, what does it look like? </p>
    <p class="answer"> I would LOVE to do a full back piece. I’ve been lucky enough to do a few full sleeves, and feel like having the trust and creative freedom to create a bespoke back piece would be such a fulfilling project!</p>
