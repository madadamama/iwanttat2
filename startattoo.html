        <p class="star-text">This was the first tattoo I got when I turned 18. I was nervous, did not know how to lie down on a tattoo bed, and was confused by the amount of Virgin Mary's there were on the wall. The confusion helped to divert the sharp pain from the needle stabbing my ankle. <br><br> And within 30 minutes, the star man was born. This lovely star has another star sibling, on my Sister's right ankle. <br><br> And as much as I like this tattoo, I would not reccomend getting a tattoo on your ankle <br><br> Pain 7/10</p>
