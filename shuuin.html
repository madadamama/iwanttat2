    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer">  
        For a long time I wasnâ€™t really interested in tattooing, in my teens in the 2010s (growing up in Colorado) I was only exposed to very white cis/het male dominated traditional American tattoo spaces and felt intimidated/like tattoo spaces werenâ€™t for me. When I first started seeing tattoos being made in non-traditional styles by queer non-white people my mind was kind of blown. I didnâ€™t know tattoos could look and feel like that, and I became a lot more interested in tattoos and what they could mean to me. I didnâ€™t start tattooing super intentionally, but while I was in art school other art/illustration careers seemed less and less appealing and by the time I was a senior at RISD tattooing was all I wanted to do all the time. I really focused in on it (sometimes sacrificing schoolwork time lol) and feel really grateful to have found it </p>
    <p class="question"> Whatâ€™s the most fulfilling aspect of your practice and whatâ€™s the most difficult aspect?  </p>
    <p class="answer"> For me itâ€™s really fulfilling to get to make whatever work I want and get to meet and collaborate with people who resonate with it in all the ways I do. I love the shared experiences and connections that are forged through tattooing (with other tattooers and clients alike) and itâ€™s part of what makes the practice so unique and powerful. I think itâ€™s been difficult for me to find confidence and boundaries with my tattoo practice, but itâ€™s getting better and easier all the time! </p>
    <p class="question"> Do you have a dream tattoo, if so, what does it look like? </p>
    <p class="answer"> Iâ€™m not someone who really plans out my tattoos because I never know exactly what I want ðŸ¤£ but I do often fantasize about starting a back piece with any one of the many artists out there whose work I admire a lot! I also want to always keep trading tattoos with other artists, it always feels extra special to carry those ones and get to have that type of interaction ðŸ’“ </p>
