    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer">  I became interested in tattooing-- and tattoos in general-- around middle school, when tattoo culture was a large thing on Tumblr, Twitter, etc. I really enjoyed the subculture of tattooing and found myself relating to it and the people. </p>
    <p class="question"> What made you decide to stick with the handpoke method instead of a machine method? </p>
    <p class="answer"> I've chosen to handpoke because the practice is a resistance against capitalism's push towards "efficiency," "productivity," and speed. Creating tattoos without intervention by machine is a meditative act for me and a constant reminder to exercise patience and intentionality.  </p>
    <p class="question"> Do you have a dream tattoo, if so, what does it look like? </p>
    <p class="answer"> I don't have a dream tattoo, but i do love any tattoo with texture and imperfections. I think illegibility in tattoos is beautiful.</p>
