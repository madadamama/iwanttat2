    <p> Rafael's dream tattoo audio transcript</p>
    <p class="tiny"> I don't have exactly a specific tattoo that I would consider as my dream tattoo, but if I were to get a tattoo, I would want something pixel related. I just like the idea of a unit building up into something beautiful, and I would have it maintained in some sort of square grid. Preferably it would be a companion tattoo. Just kidding, that's it. That's it.  </p>
