    <p> Sanchez's dream tattoo audio transcript</p>
    <p class="tiny"> Yeah, so I love bugs and I really get fascinated by all the patterns that like naturally occur on bugs. I think it's really strange how they're really perfect in some ways or sometimes they're a little bit different like when butterflies and like ladybugs or something it's like I think it's really strange like how the universe just in some ways led up to that at least you know starting from the beginning theoretically if that is what happened and then like all the way down to like our planet onto these tiny little things it's like how do these patterns just like happen you know like how does their DNA know to create patterns like that people will be like oh you know it's like natural selection and like you know with like evolution you know there some bugs look like leaves because that's what they can camouflage and stuff I'm like but I just want to know personally maybe there's already an answer but like personally for me as someone who doesn't know it's like how does it lead up to that and so I think it's really sacred like a lot of that geometry that just like occurs and like in the environment and I would want it on my back because I already do my makeup that way and I would want my back to kind of like archive it on my body almost and then like I'd want writing I don't know what writing it would be but it'd be very important writing to preserve my body or for it to like naturally decompose but it would the writing probably be something very sacred to me and really important to me that I know that I would want to keep me also looks really cool  </p>
