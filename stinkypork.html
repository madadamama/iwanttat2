    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer">   I became interested in tattooing when my friends started asking me to give them tattoos! I had always been interested in tattoos, getting tattoos, and drawing, but I didn’t consider doing the tattooing myself until a friend asked me to do it for them. </p>
    <p class="question"> What made you decide to stick with the handpoke method instead of a machine method? </p>
    <p class="answer"> I stick with handpoke because I like not having as much machinery to mess around with, for now. Its nice to work with simple materials and trust my hands. It’s a bonus that my clients often experience less pain and easier heals with handpoke, and the handmade look of handpoke tattoos have a particular beauty to them. </p>
    <p class="question"> Do you have a dream tattoo, if so, what does it look like? </p>
    <p class="answer">   I dream of big, loose architectural tattoos like <a href="#" onclick="openPopup('jannisfray.html')"> @jannisfray ‘s </a> work, abstract gradients like noapokesandprods, mossy.sticks, and warmearthworm, and a seal under dappled light reflected by the water. And fish tramp stamps.</p>
