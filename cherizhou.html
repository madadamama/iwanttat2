    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer">   I've been interested in tattooing basically as soon as I knew it existed. I knew I always wanted to get tattoos on my own body, and when I started, I found it difficult to stop, and I fell in love with the practice. I've always wanted to be a tattoo-er, but I deliberated actually doing tattoos for about two years before I finally bought myself a machine. I was lucky enough to have an immense amount of support from my friends and peers and was able to jump into the practice professionally because of it. I've been tattooing for a little over two years now! </p>
    <p class="question">What advice would you give to someone who's just starting their tattoo practice? </p>
    <p class="answer"> Practice until you're good! Learn how to sanitize really really well. Invest in your materials, only buy the best stuff. Tattooing is a very serious practice and should be treated as such. Respect your clients. Invest in the community, support your fellow artists. Don't ever stop being thankful! </p>
    <p class="question"> Do you have a dream tattoo, if so, what does it look like? </p>
    <p class="answer"> Not really! I just get them as I go. Mostly I try not to get a bunch all at one time so I can have space for when I want to get something later. </p>
