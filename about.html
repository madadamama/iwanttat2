    <p class="landing-text"> I love tattoos. <br> <br> There's beauty and intentionality behind every tattoo. Every person has different interpretations, meanings, and reasons for their tattoos; and I wanted to show that through this final.  Not every tattoo has to have a meaning, sometimes you just like what you like and want it on your body. Other times, a tattoo can remind you of a person or a memory. <br> <br> Regardless of the reason you get a tattoo, an abundance of memories and experiences will stick with you. The pain from the needle poking into your skin, sharing your thoughts and fears with the artist, hearing the poking or the machine and waiting in anticipation for what the tattoo will look like, and then finally seeing it. All those lovely experiences will stick with you. <br> <br> SO JUST GET THE TATTOO!</p>
