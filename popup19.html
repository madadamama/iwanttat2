    <p> Lavina's dream tattoo </p>
    <p class="tiny"> So where would I get this tattoo? Probably on like the upper arm area or near my ankle because I think that's cool. And what this tattoo is it's kind of taking inspiration from the hoodie design from our fellowship this year's design. <br> <br> It's quite similar but essentially it's just a reminder for me to, although I always forget and not the best at doing it is to like have God be like the thing rooting my life so that's kind of like what it represents and because of that we can be light in other people's lives which is the light bulb and then plants is just it looks cool but yeah that's kind of maybe it's a bit cringe but yeah that's the meaning of this.  </p>
