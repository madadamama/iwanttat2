    <p class="question"> How did you become interested in tattooing?</p>
    <p class="answer">  i was always interested in tattooing, so when a friend of mine was visiting and handed me their cheap amazon tattoo machine and said “gimme a tattoo!” i said… why not! and i just loved doing it so much i got my own supplies and started from there.  </p>
    <p class="question"> What’s the most fulfilling aspect of your practice and what’s the most difficult aspect? </p>
    <p class="answer"> not really something i wish i was told but i am self taught so sometimes i wish i had done an apprenticeship, mostly just for the camaraderie among artists. the friend of mine who i gave my first tattoo to is currently doing an apprenticeship and it’s interesting to see what that experience is like. I’ve been able to be successful on my own so i don’t have regrets, but it’s definitely something i think about a lot and would recommend someone getting into tattooing look for an apprenticeship, but also to not let it stop them if they can’t find one! being self taught has its own perks as well.  </p>
    <p class="question"> Do you have a dream tattoo, if so, what does it look like? </p>
    <p class="answer">  i don’t know if i have a specific dream tattoo, i haven’t done a full sleeve yet so i think that would be super cool!</p>
